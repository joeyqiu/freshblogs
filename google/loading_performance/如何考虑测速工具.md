## How To Think About Speed Tools

Google has put out a lot of guidance around performance data and performance tooling. The goal of this infographic is to consolidate this guidance for developers and marketers to help them understand how to think about performance and navigate all of Google's performance tool offerings.

Common myths about performance

![A piece of paper with a line graph on it.](./images/line-graph.png)

MYTH 1

**User experience can be captured with a single metric.**
Good user experience is not captured by a single point in time. It's composed of a series of key milestones in your users' journey. Understand the different metrics and track the ones that are important to your users' experience.

MYTH 2

**User experience can be captured with a single “representative user.”**
Real-world performance is highly variable due to differences in users’ devices, network connections, and other factors. Calibrate your lab and development environment to test a variety of such different conditions. Use field data to inform selection of test parameters for device type (i.e., mobile vs. desktop), network connections (i.e., 3G or 4G), and other key variables.

MYTH 3

**My website loads fast for me, so it should load fast for my users.**
The devices and networks that developers test load performance on are often much faster than what your users actually experience. Use field data to understand what devices and networks your users are on and appropriately mirror those conditions when you test performance.

Understanding lab vs. field data

Lab data

Lab data is performance data collected within a controlled environment with predefined device and network settings. This offers reproducible results and debugging capabilities to help identify, isolate, and fix performance issues.

Strengths

- Helpful for debugging performance issues
- End-to-end and deep visibility into the UX
- Reproducible testing and debugging environment

Limitations

- Might not capture real-world bottlenecks
- Cannot correlate against real-world page KPIs

**Note:** Tools like [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) and [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) collect this type of data.

Field data

(Also called Real User Monitoring or RUM)
Field data is performance data collected from real page loads your users are experiencing in the wild.

Strengths

- Captures true real-world user experience
- Enables correlation to business key performance indicators

Limitations

- Restricted set of metrics
- Limited debugging capabilities

**Note:** Public data sets like [Chrome User Experience Report](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report/) and performance tools like [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) speed score report this type of data.

What are the different performance tools?
